# About Personal Assistant

**Personal Assistant** is a neutral, de-branded fork of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), optimized for non-technical users. Same core features — messaging gateway, AI agent, multi-channel support — with simpler wording and minimal branding.

## Why this fork

- **Neutral tone** — No mascot or in-jokes; copy describes what the software does.
- **Non-technical focus** — Setup and docs assume less CLI/dev experience.
- **De-branded** — You can present it as “your personal assistant” without upstream product identity.

## Upstream

OpenClaw is created by Peter Steinberger and the community. For the official project, install from npm (`npm install -g openclaw`) or see [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and [docs.openclaw.ai](https://docs.openclaw.ai).
