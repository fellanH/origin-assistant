# About Origin

**Origin** is a neutral, de-branded fork of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), designed as a clean starting point for building your own AI assistant.

## Why this fork

- **Neutral tone** — No mascot or in-jokes; copy describes what the software does.
- **Non-technical focus** — Setup and docs assume less CLI/dev experience.
- **De-branded** — You can present it as your own assistant without upstream product identity.
- **Clean baseline** — A template you can customize for your personal use case.

## What you get

Same core features as OpenClaw:

- Multi-channel messaging gateway (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, and more via plugins)
- AI agent integration (Pi)
- Workspace and memory system
- macOS/iOS/Android companion apps
- Scheduling, webhooks, and automation

With simpler wording and minimal branding.

## Upstream

OpenClaw is created by Peter Steinberger and the community. For the official project with full community support, see:

- [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) on GitHub
- [docs.openclaw.ai](https://docs.openclaw.ai) for upstream documentation
- Install from npm: `npm install -g openclaw`

This fork tracks upstream and can be updated to incorporate new features.
