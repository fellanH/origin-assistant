Task 1 is complete. Here's the summary:

## Task 1 Complete: use-gateway.ts Audit

**Audit findings for `src/lib/use-gateway.ts` (1335 lines):**

| Category | Exports | Lines |
|----------|---------|-------|
| USED | `useGateway`, `useSessionStats` | ~160 |
| DEPRECATED | `useOpenClawChat` | ~800 |
| DUPLICATED | 5 types (MessagePart, etc.) | ~80 |
| INTERNAL | 5 helper functions | ~200 |

**Key finding:** `useOpenClawChat` has no external consumers — `page.tsx` uses `useSessionChat` from `use-session.ts` instead. The hook and its helpers (~800 lines) can be safely removed.

**Cleanup potential:** File can shrink from 1335 → ~200 lines.

**Output:** `tasks/AUDIT-use-gateway.md` contains the full audit with migration steps.
