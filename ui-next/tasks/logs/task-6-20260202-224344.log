Task 6 is complete. Here's a summary of what was built:

## Task 6 Complete: ChatMessageList Component

Created `src/components/chat-message-list.tsx` with smart animation strategy:

**Key Features:**
1. **Smart Animation** - Only new messages animate in, not history
2. **Session Tracking** - Resets animation state on session switch
3. **Uses ChatProvider** - Gets all data from context (messages, status, toolExecutions, subagents, etc.)
4. **Memoized** - Prevents unnecessary re-renders
5. **Complete States** - Handles loading, empty, streaming, thinking, and queued messages

**Animation Strategy:**
- Uses `initialLoadComplete` ref to track when history has loaded
- Uses `previousMessageCount` ref to track message count at load time
- Messages with `index >= previousMessageCount` animate in
- History messages get `initial: false` (no animation)

**Build passes** ✅

The component is ready to be integrated into `page.tsx` to replace the current inline message rendering, which will significantly reduce the god component's size and improve the user experience by eliminating animation jumpiness on history load.
